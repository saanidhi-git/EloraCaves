            <h1>The Ellora Caves, located near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site showcasing an incredible blend of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain rock-cut architecture. Built between the 6th and 10th centuries, the site consists of 34 caves carved into basalt cliffs, reflecting the patronage of the Vakatakas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. The Buddhist caves (1-12) feature monasteries and chaityas, the Hindu caves (13-29) depict epic tales from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and the Jain caves (30-34) display intricate carvings of Tirthankaras. The most famous structure, the Kailasa Temple (Cave 16), is the world’s largest monolithic rock excavation, carved from a single rock by removing an estimated 400,000 tons of stone. Ellora is not only an architectural marvel but also a symbol of India’s rich religious and cultural heritage, attracting visitors and historians worldwide.</h1>
